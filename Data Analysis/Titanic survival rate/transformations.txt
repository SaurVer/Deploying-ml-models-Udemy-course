Do basic data familiarisation
remove the id column
Separated numerical and object type columns
In numerical checked for continuous and discrete cariables
TF -- In each of these, cheked for null values, for continuous variables having null added median to fillna.
Discrete variables does not have null values, if it was there then fillna with mode

TF-Checked the distribution of continuous variable and do log transformation of yeo-johnshon transformation or 
some other transformation to make the distribution more gaussian. transformed Fare to make it more gaussian.

Plot discrete variables. bar of sns

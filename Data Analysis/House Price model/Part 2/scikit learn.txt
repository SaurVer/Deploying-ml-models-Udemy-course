Has three classes:

1) Estimators- A class with fit() and predict() methods. Ex: Lasso, Decision treees, SVMs are coded as estimators.

2) Transformers- fit() and transform() methods. Ex: Scalers, Feature selectors, Encoders, Imputers, Discretizers, Transformers

3) Pipeline - Allows to run transformers and estimators in sequence

Most steps are Transformers
Lat step can be Estimator

Filter methods

Pros: Model agnostic, quick feature removal, fast computation
Cons: Does not capture redundancy or correlation because it looks at features one by one. Can lead to poor performance of models


Wrapper method

Pros: Looks at interaction, considers ml models, evaluates group of methods, finds the best feature combination for a given models

Cons: Not model agnostic hence requires feature computation for each model and hence becomes more expensive.

Embedded methods 
Pros: Consider feature correlation and performs better than filter method 
Cons- Not model selection

Why do we need to engineer features or select features?

easier to:
    interpret
    deploy
    train
enhanced generalisation by reducing overfitting
reduce redundancy

Why we need to select features?

smaller json messages sent over to the model
Less lines of code for error handling
Less logging'


Variable redundancy:
Duplicates
Highly correlated
Constant value
Quasi constant values
